# Adversarial Labs
Attack vs. defense labs to train for live cybersecurity conflict. Free, for everyone.

These labs draw from Dan Borges's book, *[Adversarial Tradecraft in Cybersecurity](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/adversarial-tradecraft-in-cybersecurity-9781801076203)*.

## Introduction
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6V5FWav.png" width="200"></p>
Learning computer network security is hard. Partly, this is due to the many facets of computer science that are involved, and the intersecting I.T. concepts that one must have a background knowledge in.
<br>
But there lies another, more pressing road block to network security learning: the access to free, comprehensive learning resources. Adversarial Labs seeks to contribute to the emergence of free/affordable resources based on the fundamental belief that no one should be prevented from pursuing their passion based on a lack of funds.

Beyond this lies one more theme: Network security learning is all too often separated strictly into "offensive" and "defensive" tracks. The goal with Adversarial Labs, in addition to providing freely accessible learning materials, is to demonstrate that a complete understanding can and should be obtained by combining *both* the offense and defense at the same time. In doing so, it seeks to provide a holistic approach to computer network security that leaves students with a more realistic outlook on the sphere of live cybersecurity conflict.


# Navigation
- [Phase 1 Lab: Networks, services, and compromise](labs/cis4930_lab_phase1.pdf)
  - [Phase 1 supplemental briefing](labs/cis4930_phase1_helpdoc.pdf)

- [Phase 2 Lab: Service exploitation, SIEM/EDRs, and C2 frameworks](labs/cis4930_phase1_helpdoc.pdf)

- Phase 3 Lab: Honey trapping, TODO

# Roadmap
## Done
- [x] Define the structure of the first 3 labs, including the scenario and learning outcomes.
- [x] Implement the technical configuration of VMs that support the learning outcomes of the first 3 labs.
- [x] Deploy on a locally-owned hypervisor (ESXi) as a proof-of-concept

## TODO
- [ ] Write instructor resources to provision and teach the labs for students. This would involve a solution guide, as well as configuration details for each machine.
- [ ] Deploy on a publicly accessible hypervisor/other provisioning solution
